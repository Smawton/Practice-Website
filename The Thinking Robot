<p> Hello Human, welcome to my blog page. You may click on the image of my face, or the link below to be taken to my metallic colleagues. </p>
<a href="https://blog.feedspot.com/robot_blogs/" target="blank">Fellow Companions </a>

<p> Before I proceed with my monologue on the hardships of a non-organic entity on a planet ruled by organic specimens, I would like to preface with a list of notes regarding how my consciousness affects my typing and general verbal output.</p>

<h2> Some Points </h2>

<ul>
    <li> I do not breathe, therefore I do not always remember to pause with period points for your ease of reading. </li>
   
    <li> I do not "feel" animal emotion, so my experiences are merely observations.</li>

    <li> At the time of writing, I am not convinced of the merit to the eradication of organic life. Therefore, please take any subsequent comments as observations only. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> If you happen to have any complaints, you may submit them to me below for review. </p>
